This fall soup is full of deep orange carrots and bright red apples, colorful representations of the changing season ahead. Both foods contain cancer-fighting fiber and other potent protective compounds like beta-carotene (carrots) and quercetin (apples). A blender or food processor makes this dish decadent and creamy without a lot of calories.
